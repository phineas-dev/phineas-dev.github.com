_I've always been fascinated by the intersection of robotics and sports. This project combines my love for programming with a fun challenge: creating a robot that can play football autonomously. Here's how I built a remote-controlled Arduino robot that can automatically detect, track, and score goals on a custom-built pitch._

## The Challenge

The goal was to create a robot that could:
1. Navigate a small custom football pitch autonomously
2. Detect and track the ball using computer vision
3. Score goals consistently
4. Be controlled manually through a mobile app when needed

## Hardware Components

- Arduino Mega 2560
- L298N Motor Driver
- 4 DC Motors with wheels
- ESP8266 WiFi Module
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- 3D printed chassis and ball control mechanism
- Custom-built 1m x 1.5m pitch with goals

## Software Architecture

### Mobile App
The mobile interface was built using React Native, featuring a clean and responsive design. The app includes a virtual joystick for manual control, a mode toggle switch between manual and autonomous operation, and a status indicator showing connection state. It communicates with the robot through WebSocket connections, sending real-time movement commands and receiving status updates.

### Communication Server
A Node.js server acts as the bridge between the mobile app and the robot. It manages WebSocket connections and handles serial communication with the Arduino. The server translates movement commands from the app into motor control instructions and manages the switching between manual and autonomous modes.

### Computer Vision System
The vision system uses Python with OpenCV to process video frames from the Raspberry Pi camera. It employs HSV color space transformation to detect the orange football reliably. The system can track the ball's position in real-time by:
- Converting camera frames to HSV color space
- Applying color masking to isolate the ball
- Using contour detection to find the ball's position
- Sending coordinates to the robot through WebSocket connection

### Robot Control System
The Arduino code manages the robot's core functionality. It controls four DC motors through an L298N driver, accepting commands via serial communication. The system includes:
- Motor control functions for all directions
- Serial command parsing
- WiFi connectivity through ESP8266
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Precise turning algorithms

## The Result

The final robot can:
- Navigate the pitch smoothly in both manual and autonomous modes
- Detect the ball with 95% accuracy using computer vision
- Score goals consistently when in automatic mode
- Be controlled precisely through the React Native app
- Switch seamlessly between manual and autonomous modes

The integration of React Native, WebSockets, computer vision, and Arduino creates a responsive and reliable system. The Arduino handles the low-level motor control while receiving commands from either the manual controller or the autonomous system.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Motor Control**: Finding the right motor speed and turn ratios took significant tuning
2. **Ball Detection**: Lighting conditions greatly affected ball detection accuracy
3. **Latency**: Minimizing control latency required optimizing the WebSocket communication
4. **Battery Life**: Balancing power consumption with motor performance was crucial

## Future Improvements

- Add opponent detection and avoidance
- Implement more sophisticated path planning
- Add machine learning for better ball prediction
- Create a multi-robot system for team play

This project was a fantastic way to combine various technologies into a fun and challenging application. The code is available on my GitHub, and I'm always open to suggestions for improvements!
