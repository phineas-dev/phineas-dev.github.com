This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to work at Meta, where I taught a class of 40 students how to code. It was an experience that pushed me to my limits and taught me lessons I never expected. While I walked into the role with excitement and a love for coding, I left with a profound respect for the art of teaching—and the realization that it’s not a path I’d choose to take again.

### The Mental Load of Teaching
From the very first day, it became clear that teaching is as much about adaptability as it is about knowledge. Every lesson required constant assessment and recalibration:  
- Are the students grasping the concepts?  
- Do I need to slow down, or is it time to move on?  
- Should I provide a new analogy to make this click?  

Balancing the needs of 40 different learners felt like juggling on a tightrope. While I expected the technical challenges of answering complex questions, I didn’t anticipate the mental drain of constantly reevaluating my teaching in real time. Every pause, furrowed brow, or hesitant question became a signal that I needed to adjust, which left my brain completely exhausted by the end of the day.

### The Joys of Watching Students Learn
Despite the challenges, there were moments of joy that made the experience incredibly rewarding. Watching students progress from confusion to understanding was deeply fulfilling. Their breakthroughs—whether it was debugging a stubborn piece of code or finally grasping recursion—felt like small victories for both of us.

One student, in particular, struggled with loops early on but went on to build an impressive final project that showcased their newfound confidence. Seeing their growth reminded me why I love coding: the ability to create and solve problems in endlessly creative ways.

Those moments of connection and progress gave meaning to the mental effort I poured into each class. But even with these rewarding highlights, the process was undeniably draining.

### Lessons Learned
By the end of the summer, I came to a surprising conclusion: I wouldn’t teach again. While the experience was valuable and taught me a lot about myself, it also showed me how demanding the practice of teaching truly is. It requires endless patience, energy, and the ability to adapt on the fly—all skills I respect deeply but don’t see myself honing further.

More than anything, this experience gave me a newfound appreciation for teachers. Educators carry an incredible load, often with little recognition, and they play a pivotal role in shaping the lives of others. My time at Meta was a humbling reminder of how challenging and important this work is.

### Moving Forward
Teaching at Meta was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I’m grateful for the lessons it taught me. It pushed me to grow, gave me a deeper respect for the craft of teaching, and showed me the impact of mentorship. While I won’t be stepping into the classroom again, I’ll carry these insights with me and continue to find other ways to make a difference. Sometimes, the most valuable lessons come from understanding what isn’t your path—and that’s just as important as finding what is.
